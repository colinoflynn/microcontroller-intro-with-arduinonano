# Microcontroller Introduction with Arduino Nano

An introduction to using Arduino Nano, including Atmel Studio setup instructinos. This repository is primarily designed for students at Dalhousie University in ENGI 2203-02 class (or other introductory electrical engineering classes).

## Order of Completion

You can roughly follow the numbering in the folders (starting with 1-setup) to make sense. Additional material will be uploaded over time.

## Getting Help

No support tickets will be answered on this repo, or by email. This repo is produced purely as a useful resource, but you will need to find help via another method (if you are in ENGI 2203-02 then in-class or in-lab is suggested).


### Material License

Note that some material is covered by the Apache license in this repo. However, this repo contains other items (such as datasheets, schematics, and pinout photos) which were not made by Colin O'Flynn and are copyright the original owner. For convenience they have been added to this repository, but do not assume you can freely copy all material present.
